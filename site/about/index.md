I'm Pete LePage, a Developer Advocate on the web team at Google, based in
New York city. I take the sharp edges off bleeding edge web tech, and make
it easy for developers to use. {: .lead }

## Biography

Pete joined Google in 2011 as a Developer Advocate working on the Chrome Web
Store team and the open web platform. He's been designing websites since his
early days in high school, evolving from overlapping `<blink>`, `<marquee>`
and `<font>` tags on GeoCities to properly styled CSS, managed hosted
websites. Pete works with the web developer community to build awesome
new web applications using open web technologies like HTML5 and CSS3.

He can often be found traveling the world with his friends, seeing both
exotic and ordinary sites, or in a black and white darkroom printing
something he shot with a film camera!  He has studied and taught at the
prestigious [Photographic Center Northwest](https://pcnw.org/) in Seattle where he completed his [Thesis in Fine Art Photography](https://bbpphoto.com).

Pete keeps an irregular blog at [https://PeteLePage.com](https://petelepage.com/)
and can be found occasionally on Twitter at [@petele](http://twitter.com/petele)
