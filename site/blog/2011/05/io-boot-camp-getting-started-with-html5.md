Last week at [I/O Boot Camp](http://www.io-bootcamp.com/), [Ernest Delgado](http://twitter.com/edr) and I presented a session titled Getting Started with HTML5.

Rather than take folks through the laundry list cool new stuff that's part of HTML5, we took them through a smaller subset of features, showing how we used them in a real world application - [TweeterFall](http://bit.ly/TweeterFall).

You can watch the [video](http://bit.ly/jg95xi), check out the [slides](http://bit.ly/bootcamp-html5intro) and try [TweeterFall](http://bit.ly/TweeterFall). Â When trying the slides, be sure to try them in Chrome dev, Canary or Safari to get the full 3D effects!
