I usually try to post in my blog at least once a week, but I admit, I've been a little lacking the last few weeks.  I'm now on day 5 as a Product Manager, and not surprisingly, I still don't know what the heck I'm doing!  :)  That's fine though, I didn't really expect to come on and be 100% productive the first week either.  And I don't think [Brian](http://blogs.msdn.com/bgold/default.aspx) did either, at lease lets hope he didn't ;)

There are plenty of things that I'm working on and trying to figure out.  For example, the [IE Developer Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/ie/) has had some great work done to it, but still needs plenty more.  Thus, there is a group of us working on that.  I'm also trying to figure out what content is missing from the site.  I'm also working on getting more information about building AddOn's to the site.  There aren't many documents about how to create AddOn's and the power that they have, so that's another area.

Another focus area that I have right now is how to interact with the real world.  We don't have a great group of developers and designers who can help us to build a better browser.  I've been investigating conferences, events, and people who we should be working more closely with to create a better web.

So, I'm still here.  I've got an idea where I'm going, but still have plenty to learn.  Keep an eye out for me!
