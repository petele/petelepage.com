As I was doing some of my morning infosnacking, I came across [this](http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/06/04/2157208) post on [slashdot](http://slashdot.org). A few guys seem to have figured out how to recreate the Bellagio Fountains using only 2L bottles of diet coke, and several menthos.
