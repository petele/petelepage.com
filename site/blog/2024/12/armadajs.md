## Baseline âœ… - New web features ready to use across browsers today

Knowing what new features and APIs you can safely use can be a challenge,
will it work in the browsers you need to support? Baseline helps with that,
giving developers a way to know whether a feature is ready to use.
We'll dive into how to use Baseline to identify which features you can
confidently use in your site and which ones you'll need to do more work to
support and cover some of the key features now included in Baseline, and
how they help you create more beautiful and capable sites and applications.

Baseline gives web developers clear information about
which web platform features are ready to use in their projects today. When
reading an article, or choosing a library for your project, if the features
used are all part of Baseline, they can trust the level of browser
compatibility. By aligning with Baseline, there should be no surprises when
testing your site. Baseline status information is now available on key
developer resource sites such as MDN, Can I Use, and web.dev, making it
easier than ever to know whether a feature is ready to use.
