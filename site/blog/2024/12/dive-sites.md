I love scuba diving. It's my favorite hobby, it's so peaceful, there
are amazing things to see and experience. There are no outside interuptions,
no cell phones, no internet, no distractions. It's just you and the environment
around you.

As part of my dive log, I keep track of the sites, and I like to grab the GPS
locations when I can. I'm experimenting with making that data public. There
are sites that do something similar, but I haven't found one that is well
curated.

So, here are the sites I've been diving on, as of December 2, 2024.

If you use [Dive Log](https://www.moremobilesoftware.com/DiveLog/), you should
be able to download and import the dive site to your log fairly easily.
