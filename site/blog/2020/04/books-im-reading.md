Reading is critical to my mental health. Ever since I was a kid, I read, at
least a little bit before I fall asleep. In fact, it's almost a trained
behavior now. If I start reading during the day, I get sleepy! What I like
about reading is that it gives me an opportunity to stop thinking about the
day, put all of that aside and focus on something else. Almost like "parking"
my brain for the evening.

I want a good book, not a great book. It needs to be something I enjoy, but
easy enough to put down. If it's too good, it's easy to lose track of time
and only notice the clock at 4am!

Currently I'm reading [Dance with Dragons](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YL4LYI),
the 5th book in the Game of Thrones series. It moves slowly, but it's still
interesting. I'm not sure what I'm going to do if I finish this before the
6th book is out, which seems likely.

Here are a few other books I've enjoyed over the last few years.

The [Expanse series by James S. A. Corey](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077L6GJWW), recommended by my friend Richie. The books are good, a little too good at
times, and have caused a late night or two. The
[TV show](https://www.amazon.com/Dulcinea/dp/B018BZ3SCM) does a good job
representing the books.

[One Way](https://www.amazon.com/One-Way-S-J-Morden-ebook/dp/B076ZJMHWQ) by
SJ Morden (and the sequel [No Way](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DHKHZZG)),
was an interesting read. I'd call it a crime drama, mixed with Mars, and a
little dystopian capitalism thrown in for good measure. I had a hard time
putting it down.

The [Nexus Trilogy by Ramez Naam](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074CHRWQM),
according to Amazon, I powered through those books in about 6 days each. I
don't really remember the storyline, but I do remember enjoying them.

And finally my kryptonite, [Clive Cussler](https://www.amazon.com/Clive-Cussler/e/B000APJ4L6/)
books, specifically the [Oregon Files](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074C3D5NF)
series. Honestly these books are like eating candy to me. They're so easy to
read, but they offer no "nutritional" value whatsoever! They're super
formulaic, the action is always on, there's little character development,
but damn, they're fun!

Some of the other books I've enjoyed:

* [The Stowaway](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074ZGGVVC) by Laurie Gwen
  Shapiro (non-fiction) I thought this was fun, about a boy who tries to
  stowaway on a ship to Antarctica when the first explorers were heading down.
* [Bellevue: Three Centuries of Medicine and Mayhem at America's Most Storied Hospital](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A4ATWJU)
  by David M. Oshinsky (historical) A fascinating look at Bellevue Hospital
  in NYC, and a little history of medicine. Next time you're in NYC, go visit
  Washington Square Park, it's actually a cemetery for many of NYC's yellow
  fever victims.
* [Children of Time](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DN8BQMD/) by Adrian
  Tchaikovsky (sci-fi)
* [Mars Trilogy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075V8LBPP) by Kim Stanley
  Robinson (sci-fi)
* [Alexander Hamilton](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QJLQZI) by Ron
  Chernow (biography) This is an academic book, neat to learn some of the
  actual history, but really heavy. There were nights I didn't even finish a
  paragraph before I closed the book to go to sleep. In the end, it took me
  almost a year to finish!
* [The Desert and the Sea: 977 Days Captive on the Somali Pirate Coast](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N0SGUQC)
  by Michael Scott Moore (non-fiction)
