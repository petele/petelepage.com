The following bleaches work well for different things and are pretty useful. The
receipies are all for "stock" solutions, not working solutions. See the section
on bleaching for making working dilutions.

## Potassium Ferrocyanide (Stock)

Keeps indefinitely in dark brown bottle.

* 10 g Potassium Ferrocyanide
* 100 ml water

## Thiocarbamide 'dry' Reducer (Stock)

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Solution A</th>
      <th>Solution B</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>2.3g Iodine</li>
          <li>50ml Mthyl alcohol</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>4.6g Thiocarbamide</li>
          <li>50ml warm water</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2">
        Mix equal parts A &amp; B just before use. To use, apply with a fine brush
        and swab off with methyl alcohol. Precautions should be taken using this
        bleach as its highly flammable, and not good for you, so wear gloves, and
        never smoke around it. Put prints directly into fresh fixer without rinsing
        to make bleaching effect permanent.
