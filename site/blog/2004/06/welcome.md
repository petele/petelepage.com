As I think every other blogger has mentioned, there is always a first post, and its usually pretty lame. So here's mine. I'm a tester on the web designer surface of VisualStudio. I've been at Microsoft for about 3 years now, and have been on this team the entire time. We're working on some awesome stuff, and want to hear what you think about it.

I also own the Designer Smart Tasks that pop up next to a number of controls when they are dropped on the page. They're a great way to get stuff done quickly and easily! They were a tonne of fun to test, as they are pretty dynamic, and useful!

My main guy in crime is [BenCon](http://blogs.msdn.com/bencon/) who is the dev for this area. If you can convince the two of us to get something done, we'll do our best to make sure it has some distinction in the way the product moves.
