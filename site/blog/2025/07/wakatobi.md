Spent some time at [Wakatobi](https://www.wakatobi.com/) doing some diving 
this summer and it was **magical** to put it mildly. I would highly 
recommend it to anyone who is in the position to go.

For the first time, I took a camera, and managed to get some 
[decent photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/zqbP73yWoLbWBZPe9). For a first
time taking photos underwater, lots to learn, but got a few that I'm
proud of.
