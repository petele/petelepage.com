Did anyone else miss this? Or am I the only one?

From [CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/07/20/daylight-savings-folo050720.html)

> _Currently in Canada and the U.S., daylight time runs from April through October. The exception in Canada is Saskatchewan, which keeps its clocks the same throughout the year. _

> _The American change, due to take effect this autumn if U.S. President George W. Bush signs it into law, could cause headaches for Canadians during March and November, the two months the two countries would be out of sync._

Yay for extra daylight, but it is going to be a little weird!
