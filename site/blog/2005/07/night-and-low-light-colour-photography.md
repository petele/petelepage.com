This quarter I'm taking a night, and low light colour photography class at school and its been pretty cool so far. I've shot about 6 rolls of film, and by far, these last two are the best I've picked up yet. These are just scans of the negatives, I haven't had a chance to print them yet, so we'll see how that goes.

The one on my left is my favourite I think. The scan doesn't really do justice to the colour of the sky, but its this wonderful royal blue. When I shot this negative, it was about an 8 minute exposure, and the sky was, as far as I could tell, completely black, but when you leave the shutter open for so long, you get great colours.
