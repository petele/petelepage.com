Ugh, I think I just realized I have too many domains. And I'm most of them in some way at least!

I just merged 3 accounts that I had at GoDaddy into one, since I really don't need 3 account. No if only they would register .CA domains, I'd be all set, but in the mean time, I'll keep the 2 .CA's at my .CA registrar.
