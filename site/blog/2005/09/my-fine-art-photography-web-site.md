It's alive!*

## [http://www.BBPPhoto.com](http://www.bbpphoto.com/)

My new fine art photography web site is up and working. I've got one more tweak to do, and then I'm all set! It's running some special stuff. Basically I'm using a back end photogallery web application that provides an RSS feed, then using the RSS feeds to fill the front end with the data that I'm showing.

It may take a few minutes for DNS to finish propigating. So, if it doesn't load, check again later this morning (PST).
