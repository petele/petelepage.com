[@Paul_Kinlan](https://twitter.com/@Paul_Kinlan) [@heapwolf](https://twitter.com/@heapwolf) We're also working on the Native File System API - [web.dev/native-file-syâ€¦](https://web.dev/native-file-system/) - which would provide a way to actually save files directly to the users file system. Still in development, and Chrome only right now, but on a standards track, so maybe!
