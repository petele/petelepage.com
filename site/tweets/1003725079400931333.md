[@chrisdwheatley_](https://twitter.com/@chrisdwheatley_) [@ChromiumDev](https://twitter.com/@ChromiumDev) The mini-infobar is an interim UI element and will eventually be replaced by an icon in the omnibox. Until then, it will only appear the first time, and once dismissed, it won't appear again for ~3 months. We're working hard to get rid of it ASAP!
