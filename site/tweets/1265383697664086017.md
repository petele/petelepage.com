[@michaelkdh_](https://twitter.com/@michaelkdh_) I just tried it and I'm seeing similar issues, it's not reporting that my PWA is installed, even though it is. I've filed [bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issâ€¦](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1086686) to track it and asked the engineer to take a look.
