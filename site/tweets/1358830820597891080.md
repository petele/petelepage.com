[@thexpaw](https://twitter.com/@thexpaw) [@ChromiumDev](https://twitter.com/@ChromiumDev) I look at a custom offline page in the same way as a customized 404 page. You can use the one provided by the server, but it doesn't fit your brand/site well. There are also some fun things you can do to keep users engaged when offline.
