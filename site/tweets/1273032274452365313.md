[@davidbrunelle](https://twitter.com/@davidbrunelle) I've been using it since November, and have been happy. I was using it on Android for years before that. It doesn't have the magical switching capabilities that Android has, but I haven't really had any complaints... Also, I love my currently tiny bill!!
