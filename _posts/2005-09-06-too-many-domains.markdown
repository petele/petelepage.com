Ugh,&nbsp; I think I just realized I have too many domains.&nbsp; And I'm most of them in some way at least!

I just merged 3 accounts that I had at [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com) into one, since I really don't need&nbsp;3 account.&nbsp; No if only they would register .CA domains, I'd be all set, but in the mean time, I'll keep the 2 .CA's at my .CA [registrar](http://www.easydns.ca).
